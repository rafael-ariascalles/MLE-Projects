People who jumped on LeCun overplayed their hand, but they're still in the community, and will happily jump on other innocent remarks the second we let them think they've got a receptive audience for it. Saying that biased datasets cause problems is not a racist act, there are four lights.\\n\\n> People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.\\n\\nVery big agree! We need to incentivize outreach and risk-taking.\\n\\n> \\nSecondly, there is a reproducibility crisis. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to avoid this scenario (other than from a conference gatekeeper's perspective)? I've yet to see any. \\n\\nIf Method A is innately more able to get use out of hyperparameter tuning than Method B, then in some sense the only way to get a fair comparison between them is to tune the hyperparameters on both to the utmost limit. Abstaining from hyperparameter tuning seems like it means avoiding comparisons that are fair with respect to likely applications of interest.\", \"Amen.

I was going to make a meta-post on this topic, suggesting that the subreddit put a temporary moratorium on threads discussing individual personalities instead of their work—obvious exceptions for huge awards or deaths.
