# MLE-Projects
Practical Machine Learning Engineer projects build into the 16 Week Machine Learning Engineer Program - FourthBrain.

### Projects

1) [Consumer Behavioral Intention](./notebooks/ConsumerBehavioralIntention.ipynb): Analysis of consumer behavioral, applying techniques ranging from supervised, unsupervised learning, as well as semi-supervised learning. (Mid-term Project)

2) [Exploratory Data Analysis](./notebooks/walmart-sales-data.ipynb): Exploratory data analysis of the dataset from Walmart sales, using the framework of Pandas, Matplotlob and Sklearn. Example of a EDA process

3) [Sentiment Analysis using Huggingface pretrained model + Reddit API Usage](./notebooks/analyze-sentiment-subreddit.ipynb): Analysis of the sentiment of some reddit posts, using the framework of Hugging Face and Reddit API.

4) [PySpark Classification Models and Usage](./notebooks/subscription-prediction.ipynb): Prediction of Subscriber using PySaprk in Big Data Setup, usage of different tools for data wrangling and Model training setup.

5) [Logistic Regression + SVM + XGBoost and reference to SHAP](./notebooks/electronics-purchase-prediction.ipynb): Applied of common MLE techniques into a dataset of electronics purchase.
